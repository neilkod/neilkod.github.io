I'm an Oracle Slash. Like the Kordell Stewart type of slash.  DBA-slash-developer-slash-architect-slash-data analyst-slash-whatever-keeps-me employed.  I enjoy all things data, especially as they relate to Oracle.  

I also try and incorporate R and Python into my everyday work.  Maybe a little bit of Pentaho/Cognos, some Django, whatever it takes to get the job done.  And stay busy enough to prevent me from learning Java.

When not working, or refereeing my two boys'(6 and 9) eternal UFC bout, I enjoy cycling, running, triathlons, and whatever else that keeps me from yardwork. 

Thanks for finding my blog, sorry it took so long, and hopefully there will be enough to keep you all interested.

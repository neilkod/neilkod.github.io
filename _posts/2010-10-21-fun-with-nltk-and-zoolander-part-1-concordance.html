title: fun with nltk and Zoolander, part 1 - concordance
---
I combined a few of my favorite things, mainly hacking, python, natural language, and of course, Zoolander, and it makes for some fun output.

One of my favorite features of nltk is the <a href="http://nltk.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/api/nltk.text.Text-class.html#concordance">concordance</a> function, which basically shows the context in which a given term is used.  It is referred to early on in the nltk book and never fails to provide entertaining output(hint: see how the word kill lines up?):

A quick Google search yielded the Zoolander script <a href="http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/z/zoolander-script-transcript-ben-stiller.html">here</a>.  From there, I copied and pasted the text and saved it as zoolander.txt.

Here is the output for a few terms, as listed in the source code above.

See?  Fun indeed.  Next post, we'll generate some random text based on lines from the movie.

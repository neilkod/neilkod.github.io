title: An analysis of Oracle errors in the leaked 9/11 Pager Data
---
Yes, you read that correctly.  Here's how it started:

I'm working on some text analysis in Python and was looking for some test data.  Someone recommended I use the <a href="http://911.wikileaks.org/">9/11 Pager Data from Wikileaks</a>.  I downloaded the data, ran my program against it (which is the subject of another post) and all was well.  Got some great insight and I'll share that later.

I then started browsing the raw data in vi.  After paging down a few times, what did I see?

<img src="http://www.neilkodner.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/oracle-error.jpg" alt="oracle error" title="oracle error" width="808" height="48" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85" />

Paging down some more yielded this gem:

The gears are now spinning...

I wondered how many of these Oracle errors polluted the NYC messaging system.  Lets find out - Python to the rescue!

Final analysis?  Where can I send my resume? 

The Python code is simple - it loops through each line of the 49MB file (448k lines) and checks for an Oracle error using the regexp ORA-[0-9]{1,5} which I intended to mean the letters ORA, followed by a dash, followed by between one and five numbers.  Please feel free to correct/improve my regex-fu.  If a match is found, then add it to a dictionary as the key, and set the value to the count.  If the key is already present in the dictionary, the value gets incremented.  Finally, the contents of the dictionary are displayed, sorted by the value(frequency).

[python]
#!/usr/bin/python
import re
f=open('messages_all.txt')

pattern = re.compile(r'ORA-[0-9]{1,5}')
errors={}
for line in f:
	err = re.findall(pattern,line)
	if err:
		errors[err[0]] = errors.get(err[0],0)+1
f.close()

for k,v in sorted(errors.items(), key=lambda(k,v):(v,k)):
	print '%s\t%d' % (k,v)

[/python]

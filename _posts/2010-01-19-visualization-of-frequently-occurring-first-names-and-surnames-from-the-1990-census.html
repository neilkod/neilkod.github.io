title: Visualization of Frequently Occurring First Names and Surnames From the 1990 Census
---
A really quick visualization I did while researching data for another project.  Census.gov has a <a title="census.gov first names and surnames" href="http://www.census.gov/genealogy/names/">link</a> to the most frequently occurring first names and surnames from the 1990 census.  Surely more current data must exists; I found this dataset by accident.

The original data is tab-delimited in the format:
<ul>
	<li> Name</li>
	<li>Frequency in percent</li>
	<li>Cumulative Frequency in percent</li>
	<li>Rank</li>
</ul>
The data was already sorted by rank so it was easy to build lists of the top 500 names in each category(male first, female first,surname):

[sourcecode language="bash"]head -500 dist.female.first | awk '{print $1&quot;:&quot;$2}'[/sourcecode]

The data was then loaded into wordle for a quick visualization. Thumbnails are linked to full-size versions. Where I'm headed with this data is to build a corpus of first/last/surnames so that I can develop a spelling corrector, along the lines of <a title="Peter Norvig's spelling corrector" href="http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html">Peter Norvig's sublime spelling corrector</a>.  Think Google's Did You Mean... rather than a spel checker.  I'm plan on a proof-of-concept in Python, followed by an Oracle PL/SQL version.  Another fun project would be to calculate the probability of a given first name + surname.  I plan on spending some time searching for more current data.

title: "World Cup 2010: Analysis of tweets celebrating goals"
---
The 2010 World Cup proved to be one of the most tweeted about events of 2010.  Through the millions of tweets saved to my local Cloudera CDH3 Hadoop cluster, I wrote a quick pig script to discover the ways that people are celebrating(ok, spelling) goals.  Here are the top few variations of Goal/Gol.  The full results can be found <a href="http://www.neilkodner.com/gooool.txt">here</a>.  I'm happy to share the Pig code if anyone is interested.

A few rough visualizations, they are in need of an update. The first is a scatter between the length of the GOAL and the number of Os contained. You'll see that a lot of excited soccer fans like to use the full 140 characters in their celebrations, often using 138 Os.  Huge thanks to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/johnmyleswhite">@johnmyleswhite</a> for the inspiration and the <a href="http://gist.github.com/447830">R/ggplot2 help</a>.  You don't even want to see my original version!

And my personal favorite visualization, the number of tweets mentioning vuvuzela, hourly, during the course of the world cup.

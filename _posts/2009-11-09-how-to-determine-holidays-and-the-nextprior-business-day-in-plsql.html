title: How to determine holidays and the next/prior business day in PL/SQL
---
Here's an <strong>excerpt</strong> of a package I wrote that performs many date-related operations in PL/SQL, as they relate to business days and holidays.  It does a few interesting things, such as determine holiday dates dynamically, and then determine when the holidays should be observed.  It takes holidays falling on a Saturday/Sunday and determines if we need to observe them on a Friday/Monday.  Pioneer day, which is a state holiday only in Utah, falls on the 24th of July.

Functions next_business_day() and prior_business_day() also use recursion - if the next business day falls on a holiday, the functions recursively call themselves (redundant?) to get the following business day.

My goal is to clean this code up and (with my current clients' permission) open-source this.  This code has worked quite well for us and deserves to be shared.  

On the to-do list is to document how the holiday dates are calculated, and split out the holiday-date calculation logic from the observed-date logic.  An example is c_veterans_day below - Veteran's Day always falls on 11-November, but the constant stores the date its observed, for use in date calculations.  Another enhancement would be to add negative-number support to add_business_days()

Here is the package interface
[sql]  FUNCTION next_business_day(in_date IN DATE)
  RETURN DATE;

  FUNCTION prior_business_day(in_date IN DATE)
  RETURN DATE;

  FUNCTION add_business_days (in_date IN DATE, in_number_of_days IN NUMBER)
  RETURN DATE;

  FUNCTION first_weekday(in_date IN date,in_day_of_week IN VARCHAR2)
  RETURN DATE; 

[/sql]

and an excerpt of the package body.

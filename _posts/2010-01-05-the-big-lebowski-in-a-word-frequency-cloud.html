title: The Big Lebowski in a word frequency cloud
---
While doing some research(yeah, right!) for my latest twitter bot <a href="http://www.twitter.com/thebotlebowski">@TheBotLebowski</a>, I found a copy of the original script.  Sounded like a good candidate for a word cloud, right?  The only scrubbing of the data I had to do was to remove the capitalized character's name that's printed above every line of dialog.  A simple regexp got the job done. Â Be sure to click the image for the full-sized version.

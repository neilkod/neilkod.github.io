title: An analysis of Steve Jobs tribute messages displayed by Apple
---
Two weeks have passed since Apple's Co-Founder/CEO Steve Jobs passed away.  Upon his passing, Apple encouraged people to share their memories, thoughts, and feelings by emailing <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=rememberingsteve@apple.com" target="_blank">rememberingsteve@apple.com</a>. Earlier this week, Apple posted a <a href="http://www.apple.com/stevejobs/" target="_blank">site</a> (<a href="http://www.apple.com/stevejobs/" target="_blank">http://www.apple.com/stevejobs</a>) in tribute to Steve Jobs. According to the site, over a million people have submitted messages. The site cycles through the submitted messages.

I decided to take a closer look at what people are saying about Steve Jobs, as a whole. Looking at how the site updates, it appears to use Ajax to retrieve and display new messages. Using Chrome's developer tools, I monitored the requests it was making to get the new messages.

<a href="http://www.neilkodner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Apple-Remembering-Steve-Jobs2.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-574" title="Apple - Remembering Steve Jobs" src="http://www.neilkodner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Apple-Remembering-Steve-Jobs2-1024x892.png" alt="" width="819" height="714" /></a>
Once I found the location of the individual messages, it was trivial to download all of them. The message endpoint URLs are in the format

[html]
http://www.apple.com/stevejobs/messages/3679.json?28106802
[/html]

and a sample message looks like

[javascript]
{
mainText: &quot;This is equivalent to my mom's generation of Elvis dying for me. I am very
sadden and emotionally moved at the moment. He was more influential on my
life than my parents and friends. While my parents loved me and friends
shared fun times. Steve influenced me, motivated me to become the innovated,
creative technologist I have become. I got into computer technology in 1980
and moved to Silicon Valley because of him. I have been one of his biggest
admirers and looked to him as a mentor to push the boundaries of my own
creative abilities to develop technology solutions which I hope made a
difference and impact to the industries I worked in. We've lost a
significant influence and icon in technology. We won't see another person of
his innovation and foresight within my life time. He was the Edison of
technology. He was and is one of my biggest inspirations.

I feel I have lost a close family member&quot;
header: &quot;What Steve Jobs meant to me&quot;
author: &quot;Skip&quot;
location: &quot;&quot;
}
[/javascript]

The site makes a request to <a href="http://www.apple.com/stevejobs/messages/main.json" target="_blank">http://www.apple.com/stevejobs/messages/main.json</a> which returns

[javascript]
 {
 totalMessages: &quot;10975&quot;
 timestamp: &quot;28106802&quot;
 }
[/javascript]

So it appears that it cycles through 10975 messages. I didn't decompose the javascript powering the site to determine this, I just made an assumption. I tried querying values greater than 10975 and they returned 404. I wrote a quick python program to download the messages:

[python]
#!/usr/bin/python
import urllib2
import simplejson as json
import time
import codecs

# a page on apple's site shows the # of messages available
# start with 0 and retrieve up to message_range messages
metadata = json.loads(urllib2.urlopen('http://www.apple.com/stevejobs/messages/main.json').read())
message_range = metadata['totalMessages']

# the url for each message. i learned of this url by inspecting
# the network calls to http://www.apple.com/stevejobs
# using chrome's developer tools
url=&quot;http://www.apple.com/stevejobs/messages/%d.json&quot;

# create our destination file
# i'm using codecs because it does a better job at handling international characters
output_file = 'stevejobs_tribute.txt'
file_handle = codecs.open(output_file,'w','utf-8')

# helper function to remove tabs and linefeeds
def clean(txt):
  return txt.replace('\n','').replace('\t','')

# iterate from 0 to the max # of messages and download the message text
# for these purposes, I'm ignoring the other fields as they weren't always present
for i in range(0, message_range):
  req = url % i
  data = urllib2.urlopen(req).read()
  data = json.loads(data)
  file_handle.write(clean(data['mainText']) + '\n')
file_handle.close()
[/python]

<span style="direction: ltr;">
</span>
<span style="direction: ltr;">So now, we have over ten thousand tribute messages saved to the file <a href="https://github.com/neilkod/steve_jobs_tribute_messages/tree/master/data">stevejobs_tribute.txt</a>. What I was most interested in seeing how many of these messages contain a reference to a certain Apple product.</span>
I came up with a few search terms based on some legendary Apple product names including
<ul>
	<li>Newton</li>
	<li>Macintosh</li>
	<li>MacBook</li>
	<li>iBook</li>
	<li>Mac</li>
	<li>iPhone</li>
	<li>iPod</li>
	<li>iMac</li>
	<li>iPad</li>
	<li>Apple II family</li>
	<li>OSX</li>
	<li>iMovie</li>
	<li>Apple TV</li>
	<li>iTunes</li>
	<li>LaserWriter (yes, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaserWriter" target="_blank">Laserwriter</a>)</li>
</ul>
<div>Each product received an entry in a python dictionary. The value is another dictionary containing a regex for the product name and a count for the running totals. Some of the regular expressions are as simple as testing for an optional s at the end of the product name, some are a little more complex - check the Apple II regular expression to match all of entire product Apple 2 line. As I'm ok but not great with regular expressions, I welcome your corrections.</div>
[python]
products = {'iPhone':{'regex':'iphones?','count':0},
	'iMac':{'regex':'imacs?','count':0},
	'iPad':{'regex':'ipads?','count':0},
	'iTunes':{'regex':'itunes','count':0},
	'iPod':{'regex':'ipods?','count':0},
	'cube':{'regex':'cubes?','count':0},
	'MacBook':{'regex':'macbooks?','count':0},
	'iBook':{'regex':'ibooks?','count':0},
	'Apple TV':{'regex':'apple ?tvs?','count':0},
	'Apple II Family':{'regex':r'(apple )?(2|ii|\]\[|\/\/)([ce\+|]|gs|s)?[^0-9]', 'count':0},
	'LaserWriter':{'regex':'laserwriter?','count':0},
	'PowerBook':{'regex':'powerbook?','count':0},
	'Newton':{'regex':'newton?','count':0},
	'OSX':{'regex':'osx','count':0},
	'iMovie':{'regex':'imovie','count':0},
	'Macintosh':{'regex':'macintosh','count':0},
	'Lisa':{'regex':'lisa','count':0},
	'Mac':{'regex':'mac','count':0},
}
[/python]

Here's a screenshot of me testing the Apple II regular expression, using the excellent <a href="http://gskinner.com/RegExr/" target="_blank">Regexr</a>.

<a href="http://www.neilkodner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/apple-2-regex-testing.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-623" title="apple 2 regex testing" src="http://www.neilkodner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/apple-2-regex-testing.png" alt="" width="424" height="388" /></a>

Overall, out of 10975 messages downloaded(as of now), 2,186, or just under 20% mentioned an apple product by name. Here's the breakdown of the products mentioned:

[text]
LaserWriter        1
iMovie             3
OSX                9
iBook             22
PowerBook         22
Lisa              24
Apple TV          31
Newton            33
iTunes            52
Macintosh        163
iMac             235
MacBook          366
Apple II Family  481
iPad             574
iPod             575
iPhone           875
Mac             1315
[/text]

More than one out of every ten messages included a reference to a Mac! Nearly one in ten mentioned an iPhone - not bad for a device that's been out a fraction of the time the Mac has been available.I'm pleased to see so many references to the Apple II including several mentions of the//c, which was my first Apple product.

It's also interesting to note that out of 33 mentions of Newton, only a handful of those were about the actual Apple product - most were comparing Steve Jobs to Newton himself. Check out my <a href="http://www.neilkodner.com/2010/10/fun-with-nltk-and-zoolander-part-1-concordance/" target="_blank">earlier post on NLTK concordance</a> for details on how I did this:

[python]
import nltk
import string
f = open('stevejobs_tribute.txt').read()
f = f.translate(string.maketrans(&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;), string.punctuation)
foo=nltk.Text(f.split())
print foo.concordance('newton')
[/python]

result:

Also interesting where the number of mentions to other historical figures in the Steve Job remembrance messages. According to the submitters, Steve Jobs is clearly in some elite company. I don't know if I'd go so far as to group him with the man who brought automobiles and light bulbs to the masses but hey, we all have our priorities. All counts were determined through a simple grep command piped to wc -l.Here are a few examples:
<ul>
	<li>Einstein - 70</li>
	<li>Ford - 189</li>
	<li>Edison - 110</li>
	<li>DaVinci - 15</li>
	<li>Bill Gates - 8</li>
</ul>
Finally, I wanted to see what how people were speaking about Steve Jobs and especially what terms were being used to describe him. There was no point in performing sentiment analysis on this text as all of the texts were not only obviously positive but were also vetted by Apple for content. Using NLTK, I performed part-of-speech tagging on every word in each tribute message and then wrote some code to total the adjectives and adverbs used in the tribute messages.

The most commonly-used adjectives are

[text]
('great', 1961)
('steve', 1808)
('many', 1459)
('first', 917)
('sad', 862)
('better', 857)
('such', 727)
('best', 721)
('visionary', 645)
('new', 579)
('more', 556)
('true', 538)
('most', 476)
('creative', 471)
('apple', 435)
('other', 427)
('same', 415)
('good', 412)
('greatest', 376)
('wonderful', 373)
('sorry', 362)
('old', 325)
('brilliant', 283)
('able', 281)
('incredible', 267)
('big', 260)
[/text]

Humorously, NLTK frequently considered "Steve" to be an adjective. This is likely because it is always followed by the proper noun "Jobs." A <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/japerk/status/127054008060878848">tweet</a> from <a href="http://www.streamhacker.com">NLTK expert Jacob Perkins</a> reminded me that machines are dumb and proper nouns should be capitalized. In order to aggregate the counts, I normalized the text by converting to lowercase - I wasn't interested in nouns, only adjectives so proper nouns didn't matter to me.
The top adverbs, according to NLTK, were not as interesting, at least to me.

[text]
('so', 2220)
('never', 2111)
('not', 1897)
('always', 1798)
('just', 1402)
('now', 1028)
('truly', 989)
('only', 945)
('very', 919)
('much', 908)
('ever', 751)
('even', 743)
('really', 567)
('forever', 508)
('more', 486)
('still', 447)
('well', 398)
('most', 375)
('personally', 352)
[/text]

And finally, I ran tri-gram analysis, again using NLTK.<span style="direction: ltr;"> </span>

[python]
trigrams = defaultdict(int)
nltk_trigrams = nltk.trigrams(text)
for itm in nltk_trigrams:
  trigrams[itm] += 1
[/python]

As one would expect, the leading trigram was '<strong>rest in peace</strong>' with 1838 mentions, 16.7% of all mentions. '<strong>thank you for</strong>' was found in 1446 messages, '<strong>will be missed</strong>' was found in 827 messages. Other interesting trigrams are '<strong>thank you steve</strong>' with 791 mentions and '<strong>changed the world</strong>' with 551 mentions.

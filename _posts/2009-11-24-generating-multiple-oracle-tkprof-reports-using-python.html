title: Generating multiple Oracle TKPROF reports using Python
---
Recently, a customer told me that they felt a batch job was taking too long each night, I gave them a few commands to add to their nightly run.

[sql]
alter session set tracefile_identifier='charging_batch';
exec dbms_monitor.session_trace_enable;
[/sql]

These commands named the tracefile and enabled 10046 logging.

Since I'm lazy(the good kind), I figured I'd use Python to build the commands to run TKPROF for each process.  The program expects to be run from the udump directory.  As I get more time I'll enhance it to automatically grab the location of udump from the database.

The script takes an optional parameter for a tracefile identifier.  If the parameter is passed, filenames containing the identifier text will be processed.  Otherwise, all tracefiles are processed.  A to-do item is to make sure the tracefile is an actual 10046 before running TKPROF against it.

The output format is the optional tracefile identifier_process_id.out.  The file suffix can be overridden with variable tkprof_suffix.  I use .out as an homage to Michael Levy, wherever he may be, who showed me how to use the tool way back in 1998.

[python]
#!/usr/local/bin/python
# tkprof.py
# kodner 2009
# and runs a simple tkprof on them
import sys
import os
import re
sort = &quot;fchqry&quot; #parameterize this
tkprof_suffix = 'out' #this too

# find a string to be used as a tracefile identifier
# to limit the tracefiles processed
try:
  tracefile_identifier = sys.argv[1]
  print &quot;&quot;
  print &quot;&quot;
  print &quot;tracefile identifier supplied is: %s&quot; % (tracefile_identifier)
  print &quot;&quot;
  print &quot;&quot;
except:
  tracefile_identifier = None

# lists the files with suffix .trc and contain out suffix .trc
traces=[x for x in os.listdir('.') if x.endswith('.trc')]

for file in traces:
  tracefile = None

  # extract the process id from the filename.
  # I'm sure this could be done better.  i split it into multiple
  # lines for readability.

  processNum = re.findall(r'ora_[0-9]+',file)
  processNum = processNum[0].split('_')[1]

  # if a tracefile_identifier is supplied then make sure our current file
  # contains the string.  we'll also make sure the output filename contains
  # the tracefile identifier.

  if tracefile_identifier:
    if file.find(tracefile_identifier) &gt; 0:
      tracefile = file
      outputfile=tracefile_identifier + '_' + processNum + '.' + tkprof_suffix
  else:
    tracefile=file
    outputfile=processNum + '.' + tkprof_suffix

  if tracefile:
    print &quot;processing tracefile %s ...&quot; % (tracefile)

    # using regexp, find the process number of the file.
    # the process number will be used to name the tkprof output file

    # we will assume that the tracefile name is in the format
    # $ORACLE_SID_ora_$PROCESSNUM.trc
    # and that the tracefile name may contain a tracefile identifier
    # set by using alter session set tracefile_identifier = 'foo';

    # generate the tkprof command use flags sys=no and waits=yes
    command=&quot;tkprof %s %s sys=no waits=yes sort=%s&quot; % (tracefile,outputfile,sort)

    # execute the command
    os.system(command)
[/python]

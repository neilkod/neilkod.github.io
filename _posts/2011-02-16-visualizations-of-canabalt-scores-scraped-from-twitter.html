title: Visualizations of Canabalt scores scraped from twitter
---
<a href="http://www.canabalt.com/">Canabalt</a>, a ridiculously addicting web/IOS-device game allows one to show off their high scores, and their <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/neilkod/status/37964035903324160">not-so-high scores</a> to Twitter.

<a href="http://www.neilkodner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/canabaltscore.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-485" title="canabaltscore" src="http://www.neilkodner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/canabaltscore-300x105.png" alt="" width="300" height="105" /></a>

Each of these tweets contains a bit of information - The score represented in meters, the method of death (hitting a wall and tumbling to my death) and the device (iPhone). Other useful information can easily be extracted such as the date/time played and information about the user (name, location, friend count, follower count, etc). Over the next few weeks I aim to see what features, if any, has any influence on Canabalt scores.

The first thing I needed to do was capture the tweeted Canabalt scores. I have a process running on an EC2 micro instance that downloads tweets from the Twitter Streaming API based on certain key words, one of them being canabalt. The process loads each matching tweet into a MongoDB instance hosted on <a href="http://www.mongohq.com">MongoHQ.com</a>.

[bash]

curl -s -u $TWITTER_USERNAME:$TWITTER_PASSWORD -d @/home/ec2-user/trackingkeywords http://stream.twitter.com/1/statuses/filter.json |/home/ec2-user/mongodb/bin/mongoimport &amp;

[/bash]

Where trackingkeywords is a file containing a comma-separated list of keywords that I track on twitter. Additionally, I left connection details out of the mongoimport command. You'll need to provide a host, port, database, and collection into the mongoimport command.

I then run some python code to query the MongoDB instance and retrieve tweets mentioning Canabalt, based on a simple regular expression. I'm expecting the tweet to begin with 'I' and contain the word Canabalt. Pretty naive but it worked fine. If it's not a true Canabalt score, I'll be able to determine in no time. From there, I use regular expressions to extract(for now) the score, the method of death, and the device name.

[python]
def canabalt_tweets():

	# connect to MongoDB
	tweets = create_connection(False)

	# regular expression to extract components of a canabalt score
	canabalt_regexp = re.compile(r'I ran (\d{3,7})m before (.*) on my ([^.]+)\.')

	# regular expression to match tweets that begin with I ran and mention canabalt
	regexp = re.compile('^I ran .*canabalt')

	# create a MongoDB cursor(query)
	cur = tweets.conftweets.find({'text': regexp}, {'text': 1})

	# iterate through the cursor. If a tweet fits the pattern, print it.
	for item in cur:
		try:
			(score,death,device) = canabalt_regexp.search(item['text']).groups()
			print ','.join([strip_text(score),strip_text(death),strip_text(device)])
		except:
			pass
[/python]

Function strip_text() is part of my data tools Bat-Utility Belt and cleans text by removing leading/trailing spaces, crlf, tabs and some other junk.

We now have some comma-separated data in this shape

[text]
score,death,device
2860,hitting a wall and tumbling to my death,iPhone
3427,hitting a wall and tumbling to my death,iPad
4496,hitting a wall and tumbling to my death,iPad
3635,missing another window,iPhone
2040,colliding with some enormous obstacle,iPhone
6017,somehow hitting the edge of a billboard,iPhone
8374,knocking a building down,iPhone
2939,hitting a wall and tumbling to my death,iPad
2021,turning into a fine mist,iPad

Now for some more fun - visualization and analysis. This is performed in R because, well, R is awesome. That, and I really need some more practice with R.

To date, I've collected just over 1200 Canabalt 'events'. I will likely turn this into a web app if there's enough interest.

A couple of summaries:

scores by device type:

And now, in the spirit of killing the almighty ink-data ratio, here are some pictures:

What have we learned? So far, while my data set isn't altogether that large(1200 events), we might have enough to make some basic observations and assumptions(correction please!). Going into this experiment I thought that iPad players would have generally higher scores. This is because of #1 the larger screen size and #2 players wouldn't necessarily be playing 'on-the-go' as they would be (I know I am) on an iPhone or iPod touch. The iPad has higher median and average scores than the other devices. I'd like to revisit this as I collect more data.

The leading cause of Canabalt death, by far, is hitting a wall and tumbling to one's death. This surprised me as I thought it would be falling to death - that's how my Canabalt games seem to end.

I'd like to hear your comments suggestions for new analysis, and most of all, your corrections.  You know who you are and this is how I learn. The data and python/R source can be found on <a href="https://github.com/neilkod/canabalt">github</a>.

Things I learned working on this: <a href="http://had.co.nz/plyr/">plyr</a>(group-by and aggregation in R), sorting dataframes in R, couple of new <a href="http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/">ggplot2</a> tricks.

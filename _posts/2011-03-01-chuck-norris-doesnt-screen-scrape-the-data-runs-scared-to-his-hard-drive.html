title: Chuck Norris doesn't screen-scrape, the data runs scared to his hard drive.
---
Inspired by a <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/infoarbitrage/status/42611272902115328">tweet</a> from <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/infoarbitrage">Roger Ehrenberg</a> and my 11-year-old son who's crazy about Chuck Norris facts, I screen-scraped the contents of <a href="http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com/" target="_blank">http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com</a>. Code and data can be foundÂ <a href="https://github.com/neilkod/chucknorrisfacts">here</a>.

Using Python and <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">BeautifulSoup</a>, it simply loops through all of the pages on <a title="www.chucknorrisfacts.com" href="http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com" target="_blank">http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com</a> and reads the items displayed on the page.

[python]

#!/usr/bin/python
import urllib2, time
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup, BeautifulStoneSoup

# 674 pages last time I checked. Oddly enough, their pages seem zero-based. Additionally, if you
# substitute an arbitrary number, outside of the range of pages, you'll get data back instead
# of 404. I'm not sure why they're doing this.
for page_num in range(0,674):
	url = 'http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com/all-chuck-norris-facts?page=%d' % page_num
	html = urllib2.urlopen(url)
	soup = BeautifulSoup(html)

	entries = soup.findAll(&quot;li&quot;,&quot;views-row&quot;)
	for entry in entries:

		# use BeautifulStoneSoup to remove any HTML-escaped text that BS returns.
		the_quote = BeautifulStoneSoup(entry.div.text,
		                   convertEntities=BeautifulStoneSoup.HTML_ENTITIES).contents[0]

		# print it to stdout. I just redirect the program's output to a file.
		print the_quote.encode('utf-8')
	# be a good citizen and wait a few seconds before visiting the next page
	time.sleep(6)

[/python]

Output looks like

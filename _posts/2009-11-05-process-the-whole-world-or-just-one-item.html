One of my favorite PL/SQL techniques used in batch job development is to add an extra parameter, default it to NULL, so that I can test a single account at a time.  

example
[sql]
CREATE PROCEDURE bill_employers(in_employer_id DEFAULT NULL)
IS
BEGIN
  FOR employer in
    SELECT  emp.employer_id
         ,  emp.account_number
         ,  emp.bill_amt
      FROM  employer emp
     WHERE  emp.employer_id = NVL(in_employer_id,emp.employer_id)
  LOOP
    --Do stuff here
  END LOOP;
END;
[/sql]

So the real trick is the NVL in the where clause - If I supply a value for in_employer_id that's the only one that'll get processed.  
[sql]
exec bill_employers(in_employer_id =&gt; 12345);
[/sql]

If I don't pass a value at all, we'll process the whole set because of the NVL - if in_employer_id is NULL, then the rvalue becomes the same as the lvalue.
[sql]
exec bill_employers;
[/sql]

title: A few quick observations on StackOverflow questions tagged R
---
While browsing through <a href="http://www.datawrangling.com">Pete Skomoroch's </a> <a href="http://delicious.com/pskomoroch/">delicious bookmarks</a>(which is a full-time job in and of itself), I learned that <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow.com</a> makes their underlying q&amp;a data <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/11/creative-commons-data-dump-nov-09/">available</a>.

Just for fun, I wrote a few quick queries against this dataset, centered around the R tag.  Here are a handful of findings - data is through 31-Oct-2009.  Some of this data is already presented in the StackOverflow site but bear with me here.

The most common tags associated with R are:
statistics - 46
ggplot2 - 20
plot - 13
graphics - 10
vector - 9
emacs - 8
matrix - 8

We all know that Dirk, Shane, and Hadley lead the way in terms of questions answered, but who knew that chris_dubois leads the pack when it comes to answering their own question with 10?  

And finally, out of 20 posts totaling 32 answers <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ggplot2">tagged with ggplot2</a>(at the time),<a href="http://www.had.co.nz/">Hadley Wickham</a>, the <a href="http://www.had.co.nz/ggplot2/">package's</a> author has only contributed three answers.  The fact that the rest of the questions were answered by users speaks <strong>volumes</strong> of the community behind ggplot2. Excellent Work, Hadley!

Here is my version of the leaderboard as of the end of October, 2009.

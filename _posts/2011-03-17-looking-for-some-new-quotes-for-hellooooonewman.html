title: Looking for some new quotes for @HelloooooNewman
---
I'm looking for some new quotes for my Seinfeld-quote-spewing twitter bot <a href="http://www.twitter.com/#!/neilkodsbots">@hellooooonewman</a>. There are currently 161 tweets in its database and the bot has sent over 246,000 tweets. If you take a simple average, each quote has been tweeted over 1,500 times. Its time to update the bot with some fresh content.

I'm admittedly not the biggest Seinfeld fan so I need your help! Please leave some new quotes in the comments. The quotes will make it back into <a href="http://www.twitter.com/#!/hellooooonewman">@HelloooooNewman</a>'s replies. Ideally the quotes are no longer than 125 or so characters in length to allow for a username to be included in the reply. My program will truncate any tweets longer than 140 characters. Full quote database after the break.
